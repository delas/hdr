# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This University project, aims to experiment with Neural Networks technology. The objective, as the name said, is the recognition of handwitten digit.

An example of the recognized digits is:

As Neural Networks library I used [FANN library](http://leenissen.dk/fann/) (Fast Artificial Neural Networks), in its origial C version: a great project. A great thank to all authors.
