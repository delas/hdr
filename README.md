# Handwritten Digit Recognition [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/delas/hdr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/delas/hdr)

This University project, aims to experiment with Neural Networks technology. The objective, as the name said, is the recognition of handwitten digit.

An example of the recognized digits is:

As Neural Networks library I used [FANN library](http://leenissen.dk/fann/) (Fast Artificial Neural Networks), in its origial C version: a great project. A great thank to all authors.
